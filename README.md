# Project Title

## Description
This project implements an API for ingesting stock data using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern, fast, web-based framework for building APIs with Python. The ingested data is then persisted in a PostgreSQL database. The project follows the architectural principles of Ports and Adapters, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to ensure maintainability, scalability, and modularity.

## Features
- Ingestion of stock data via API endpoints.
- Persistence of ingested data in a PostgreSQL database.
- Implementation of Ports and Adapters architecture for separation of concerns and modularity.
- Application of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for designing a robust domain model.
- Utilization of Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices for high code quality and reliability.
- Implementation of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for separating read and write operations.
